It not only gives us a way to understand what's going on in space if we want to travel there, but it also gives us a way to link various D&D settings together. Your characters from Toril (Forgotten Realms) could visit Oerth (Greyhawk) or Exandria (Critical Role).",

Why make another Spelljammer supplement when there are so many already? The answer for me is simple: I'm not a fan of the vehicle combat system in D&D. While D&D 5e has started to make some steps in the right direction with Ghosts of Saltmarsh and Descent Into Avernus, there are other tabletop roleplaying systems that have advanced vehicle mechanics in cool ways. In this supplement, it is my goal to adapt mechanics from those other systems for D&D 5e and use it in the Spelljammer universe.",
                "So the most important thing to note right now is this: If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Spelljammer 2e to 5e, this supplement isn't that.",
                "In this document, what you'll find is a 5e-compatible system for running vehicle combat based off of the ship combat system designed by Mage Hand Press for their Dark Matter campaign setting. While I have made many changes to their system to adapt it to Spelljammer, the system used here is ultimately derived from their system. I made use of this system because it makes vehicle combat mirror the D&D 5e mechanics we are already familiar with from normal combat. Check out {@link Mage Hand Press|https://store.magehandpress.com/} and {@link Dark Matter|https://store.magehandpress.com/products/dark-matter-alpha?variant=15513911263314} for more!",

This section will go over the different parts of a spelljammer, some customization you can do, example spelljammer stat blocks, and finally the rules for ship combat.",

We didn't know as much about the universe as we do today, which means we had a number of neat ideas that were ultimately debunked, but were nonetheless kind of interesting. Since Spelljammer is all about this aesthetic, it makes these beliefs into truth. The goal is to create a universe where traveling through space is similar to people setting sail to the new world.",

You'd also be aware of the glittering asteroids around Selune called Selune's Tears. Lastly, you'd know there are stars.",

All of these count as being celestial bodies. An important thing to remember is that these celestial bodies are crafted and sculpted, rather than a byproduct of natural forces.",
                "I bring up this distinction because it means that celestial bodies are not bound to the normal laws of physics in how they are shaped. You can have ringworlds that aren't just futuristic technology, but made of natural materials like any other planet. You can have a ribbon of water flowing in and between asteroids in an asteroid belt. You can have a planet that is completely hollow and people live on the inside surface of the sphere. You can have square worlds. Triangular worlds. Disc worlds. You are not bound to how physics shaped celestial bodies in the real world, they were crafted by gods long since forgotten, which means what resides in space is limited only by your imagination.",
                "Comparing this against the experiences of a ship during the Age of Sail, a celestial body is like a port or an island. You can go there to resupply if it is a port, you can make landfall if you need to bury some treasure, or anything like that."

After you travel up for long enough away from your planet, you'll eventually reach a threshold where air and gravity stop. This is the boundary between a planet and what we call {@b wildspace}.",
                "Wildspace is probably easiest just to define as what we normally think of as space. It's the empty black void up there that stuff moves around in. It is the place that celestial bodies reside, the inky sea through which the spelljammers sail, and the lair of numerous beasts.",

So when we look at the wildspace of Forgotten Realms, it's like we're looking at a region of islands.",

                "The first challenge you face in leaving your planet (island) is gravity. Think of gravity kind of like a powerful rip tide, pulling you back in whenever you try to leave. Unlike in real life, gravity is an all-or-nothing force. It's either on or it's off.  When it is on, it pulls like earth-normal gravity, and when it is off, it doesn't pull at all. In other words, gravity doesn't get stronger or weaker based on the source, it only goes out farther from the source. Anything that is at least 25 feet in a dimension is a source of gravity.",
                "Now you might ask, how does this never come up in a normal game? The answer has to do with how gravity fields overlap. When there are two sources in close contact, the larger gravity field trumps the smaller one. Since nothing on a planet, not even a Tarrasque, is bigger than the planet itself, the planet's gravity always wins. When in wildspace, gravity fields can overlap, so long as their sources don't touch.",
                "Another odd feature about gravity is that it is defined as always pulling in the direction most convenient for the source. This usually results in a single gravity source that pulls all things toward it. For example, a planet will always pull you toward the core. A titanic sized giant would have a gravity field under its feet, allowing it to walk through space as if there were ground under its feet. Ships have a gravity plane that pull crew members down to the deck. So long as they don't get too close to a planet, they're fine!",
                "This has some fun outcomes worth considering. First, imagine a classic Age of Sail style ship, like from Pirates of the Caribbean. There's a main deck, sails, masts, and all of that. The gravity field runs horizontally along the main deck, meaning that when you are standing on the top deck, you're pulled down to it. If you go inside the ship, the floor of the first floor is the bottom side of the main deck! Luckily, most ships that go into space are designed to make the gravity field pull to the lowest deck, so this doesn't always come up.",
                "Another neat image of this is if you were to fall off the side of a spelljammer, you'd fall down until you cross the gravity plane, but then your momentum would be flinging you up against gravity. You'd be pulled back up to the field and flung up a bit, before being pulled back down. So you'd bobble up and down at the gravity plane. This also means that when you go below deck, you need to fall forward and up, so the first floor you're on is the underside of the deck of the ship. To go deeper into the ship, you have to climb stairs or ladders.",
                "Groundlings never have to deal with this because a planet is so large that its gravity field nullifies anything else that could ever create one short of magical means."

                "The second challenge is air. How are you supposed to breath when you get up there? Won't we just suffocate? Luckily not!  In the Spelljammer universe, all creatures and objects have an air bubble around them proportional to their size. This is a lot like the gravity field (and conveniently, they are always the same size), except that all things have an air bubble while only particularly large things have gravity. What this means is, as soon as you find a way off of your planet against gravity, you're also going to be beyond the planet's air envelope.",
                "While in wildspace, you only have the air that you bring with you. Since spelljammers are so large, they carry a sizable air bubble with them wherever they go. Similarly, massive creatures like dragons that fly through space carry their own air bubble that can sometimes be enough to sustain them for trips. However, you do run the risk of using up all your air! Every spelljammer has a number of days it can sustain people. When this period expires, the air becomes foul and gives all creatures that breath disadvantage on all checks. The second time it expires, the air becomes lethal and all creatures that breath gain a point of exhaustion each minute they breath the lethal air.  Luckily, getting new air isn't too difficult! Whenever two air envelopes come into contact, the air distributes itself evenly between the overlapping envelopes. If two equal sized air envelopes overlap, and one of them is completely fresh and the other just hit lethal, they both split the difference and become foul. This isn't the best way to get new air.",
                "The most common way to get new air is to bring the spelljammer close enough to a planet that the spelljammer's air envelope overlaps with the planet's air envelope. The planet has so much air, the spelljammer's air bubble is replenished in full. It is also possible to replenish an air bubble from air pockets found around asteroids, though the air supply here is less plentiful than a planet.",

As simply as it can be stated, the idea is that there can't be a nothing, so there must be a something. There is a substance to space, it isn't just void, and that substance is aether. As recently as the 19th century, there were arguments that aether as matter was necessary for light to travel through space.

                "Wildspace is filled comprised of aether. I described wildspace as being a sea with islands in it. If that's the case, aether is the water that makes up the sea. It can even have flows that aid or hamper travel around wildspace.",
                "This aether is important to us because it is the way we escape from our planet. Although a planet is surrounded mostly by air, there are aether currents that stretch down from wildspace to the planet itself. These aether currents help a ship that can detect them to safely sail up from or down to a planet without needing to worry about a planet's gravity field Luckily, the Helmsman of a spelljammer is able to see these invisible currents and easily travel along them.",
                "If a planet is an island, wildspace is the sea, the aether is the water that comprises the sea, then these ether currents are like large rivers, bays, and inlets. These make navigating from an island to the sea significantly easier. Just as different groups during the Age of Sail looked to control port cities, bays, and riverways, so too do factions in Spelljammer seek to control these points of entry into and out of a planet.",
                "To bring that comparison even further, just like natural rivers, bays, and harbors, it is possible for a catastrophe to occur that causes them to dry up and no longer provide any access to sailing ships! What if some major magical catastrophe befalls a planet and it causes the aether currents to get scrambled? Well, that's going to cause a rush to control the new locations! Or worse, what if there are no ways to get down to that planet anymore?",
                "The idea of aether is not one originally present in Spelljammer. In Spelljammer, simply having a Helm with a spellcaster is sufficient to propel the spelljammer free of the gravity of a planet. I choose to incorporate this idea as I think it plays nicely with the Age of Sail aesthetic."

Teleportation, plane shifting, conjuring food, speaking to a planar being, even using a bag of holding all fail in the phlogiston (though the bag of holding does resume functionality when back in wildspace!)

So how do these fit in Spelljammer?",
                    "In terms of lore, they really don't. In classic Magic the Gathering lore, each world is its own universe and planeswalkers are the only ones who travel between them.  You couldn't simply fly up from Theros through Nyx and eventually get to Ravnica, as the universe has a solid ending point. In that way, it's more like Ravenloft.",
                    "When it comes to using Magic the Gathering settings in a Spelljammer game, you simply need to relax the rigidity of that part of the lore. Many of these settings already are established as planets or moons, it's just that there's nothing if you sail out into space. So instead of saying it just ends, put the threshold of a crystal sphere there. Some settings might do better as a plane instead of a sphere, like Lorwyn. Lorwyn is full of fairy tale creatures brutally killing one another over and over. That would fit nicely in the Feywild perhaps demi- plane of the Feywild."

It had been occupied before, but those occupants were long since gone.  Ina short time, a bandit king named Cozar managed to bring all of the other pirates on the Rock under his sway. Over time and under his rule, the Rock started to become a more legitimate settlement instead of just a pirate's den. As the city grew, Cozar eventually put out a public ban on piracy as a means to drive more trade through the Rock.",

While committing piracy around the Rock is responded to, everyone sort of looks the other way if you are a pirate looking to fence some goods you got elsewhere. The worst crime is that which endangers the Rock itself. Prisoners found guilty are gifted to the illithid embassy.",
                        "Cozar's son, Frun, wasn't as efficient a leader as his father.  It was during this time that the ruling house started to delegate more tasks to various factions on the Rock. Many different factions and royalty started to arise.",
                        "When Frun died, his eldest son Calar took over. Within a week, Calar was assassinated, passing the throne on to Andru, the younger son. Unlike his elder brother and father, Andru took after his grandfather. Within a week, Andru claimed to have found the assassins and had them executed.  Yet, rumors go around that the alleged assassins were actually people Andru owed money to and he conspired to kill his older brother to get the throne and remove those he was indebted to. No one knows for sure.",

Jeff Grubb got around this by creating another substance called smoke powder, an alchemical combination that explodes with more force and can explode from contact with the air. Since gunpowder doesn't work in some settings (like Forgotten Realms), this offered Spelljammer a way to keep an explosive substance while remaining setting neutral",

Your players then think up ways of using their tools ('I'm proficient in navigator's tools, so I'd like to plot a course through the asteroid field') and you assign a DC. Let them roll to see if they are successful. The goal is for them to get 3 successes before 3 failures. Greater challenges might need 4 or 5 successes, but 3 failures is always the end.",

            "Most of the spelljammer mechanics I've spoken about so far snap in nicely with D&D 5e. There is one mechanic that needs to be added as it is unique to being in a vehicle: maneuverability. Generally speaking, maneuverability is the degree to which the spelljammer can turn while in motion. In ground combat, we're used to being able to move in any direction up to our speed In spelljammer combat, that is only the case for a spelljammer with perfect maneuverability.  Envision a ship sailing on the sea: If they want to turn, they have to adjust sails and come around in an arc. It is rare that a ship can simply turn on the spot like an adventurer can in groundling combat.",

To help visualize the cone in which a spelljammer can move, refer to the diagrams at the bottom of this page. After the spelljammer completes its movement within this cone, it can turn. Every 45\u00b0 of its maneuverability represents one turn among the eight directions it can face. For example, a spelljammer with 45\u00b0 facing north can turn 1 time to face NE or NW after moving.",

It retains its air bubble until expended Since hull points represent such a large number of regular hit points, you can imagine you're going to want special weaponry!
